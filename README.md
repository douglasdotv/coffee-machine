This is my own solution for [Coffee Machine](https://hyperskill.org/projects/67?track=18), a Kotlin project.

As the name suggests, it's a simulation of a coffee machine written in Kotlin. It has a main function that takes user inputs to perform various actions such as buying coffee, filling the machine with resources, taking money out of the machine, displaying the remaining resources, and exiting the program. The coffee machine has certain resources such as water, milk, coffee beans, and disposable cups, and money stored in the machine. The available resources and the current state of the machine are stored as properties of the CoffeeMachine class. The different actions are implemented as methods of the CoffeeMachine class.

My main goal with this project was to get started with Kotlin.
